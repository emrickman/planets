NEPTUNEEEEEEEEEEE
I MISS PLUTO......
I prefer Jupiter, sssssh don't tell anyone
cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem
But Mars is an awesome planet.
Maybe we should move to Mars forever???
We should definitely leave tomorrow!
Jupiter >>> Mars 4 ever!
We can figure this out eventually!!!
Poor Pluto!
I learned so much working with you! This is more fun than texting, lol. 
Texting with a learning curve.
